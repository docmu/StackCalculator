# StackCalculator

# Description
This application takes in a String mathematical expression which could be numbers or varables and an array with the values for those 
variables. It solves the expression by converting the infix expression into postfix. Stacks are used to push and pop elements depending on
priority accordingly. JUnit tests are available for edge cases.
